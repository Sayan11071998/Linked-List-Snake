# ***🚀 Project Milestone: Linked List Snake 2D! 🎮🐍***

🌟 Super excited (and a little nostalgic 😄) to share my latest project: Linked List Snake 2D! Built with C++ and SFML, it’s not just a game—it’s a blend of childhood memories and coding creativity.

## **🎯 What Makes It Special?**
### *👉 🍕 Junk food effects:*
Pizza, burger, and cheese make your snake grow through Linked List insertions at the head, middle, or tail.
👉 🍎 Healthy food effects:
Apple, mango, and orange shrink the snake with Linked List deletions at the head, middle, or tail.
👉 💀 Poison: Cuts the snake in half—ouch! 😱
👉 🍻 Alcohol: Reverses the snake’s direction with Linked List reversal magic.
👉 🎮 Customization: Choose between Single or Doubly Linked List modes and see real-time operations with time complexities displayed!
👉 ⚡ Intense Gameplay: Dodge obstacles and avoid self-collision—because if you don’t, it’s game over 💔.

✨ Why I’m Proud of This Project:
💡 Data Structures in Action: Mastered Linked Lists and explored STL vectors, all while solving complex challenges.
🧩 Clean Code: Applied OOP principles to create scalable, modular, and flexible code.
🎨 Game Dev Skills: Brought the game to life with smooth visuals, animations, and immersive sound effects using SFML.
🚀 Level Design: Created multiple levels with unique obstacles and layouts, enhancing replayability and player engagement.
🧠 Problem-Solving: Tackled tough challenges, like syncing Linked List operations with real-time gameplay mechanics, for a seamless experience.
