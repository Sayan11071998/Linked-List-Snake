# Linked List Snake 2D

## Project Milestone

Super excited (and a little nostalgic) to share my latest project: **Linked List Snake 2D**! Built with **C++** and **SFML**, this isn’t just a game—it’s a blend of childhood memories and coding creativity.

## What Makes It Special?

- **Junk Food Effects**  
  - **Pizza**, **Burger**, and **Cheese** make your snake grow via linked list insertions at the **head**, **middle**, or **tail**.
- **Healthy Food Effects**  
  - **Apple**, **Mango**, and **Orange** shrink the snake with linked list deletions at the **head**, **middle**, or **tail**.
- **Poison**  
  - Cuts the snake in half—ouch!
- **Alcohol**  
  - Reverses the snake’s direction with linked list reversal magic.
- **Customization**  
  - Choose between **Single** or **Doubly Linked List** modes and see real-time operations with time complexities displayed.
- **Intense Gameplay**  
  - Dodge obstacles and avoid self-collision—because if you don’t, it’s game over.
