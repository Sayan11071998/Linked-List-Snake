# ***🚀 Project Milestone: Linked List Snake 2D! 🎮🐍***

🌟 Super excited (and a little nostalgic 😄) to share my latest project: Linked List Snake 2D! Built with C++ and SFML, it’s not just a game—it’s a blend of childhood memories and coding creativity.

## **🎯 What Makes It Special?**
### *👉 🍕 Junk food effects:*
- Pizza, burger, and cheese make your snake grow through Linked List insertions at the head, middle, or tail.
### *👉 🍎 Healthy food effects:*
- Apple, mango, and orange shrink the snake with Linked List deletions at the head, middle, or tail.
### *👉 💀 Poison:* Cuts the snake in half—ouch! 😱
### *👉 🍻 Alcohol:* Reverses the snake’s direction with Linked List reversal magic.
### *👉 🎮 Customization:* Choose between Single or Doubly Linked List modes and see real-time operations with time complexities displayed!
### *👉 ⚡ Intense Gameplay:* Dodge obstacles and avoid self-collision—because if you don’t, it’s game over 💔.

## **✨ Why I’m Proud of This Project:**
- **💡 Data Structures in Action:** Mastered Linked Lists and explored STL vectors, all while solving complex challenges.
- **🧩 Clean Code:** Applied OOP principles to create scalable, modular, and flexible code.
- **🎨 Game Dev Skills:** Brought the game to life with smooth visuals, animations, and immersive sound effects using SFML.
- **🚀 Level Design:** Created multiple levels with unique obstacles and layouts, enhancing replayability and player engagement.
- **🧠 Problem-Solving:** Tackled tough challenges, like syncing Linked List operations with real-time gameplay mechanics, for a seamless experience.
