# ***🚀 Project Milestone: Linked List Snake 2D! 🎮🐍***

🌟 Super excited (and a little nostalgic 😄) to share my latest project: Linked List Snake 2D! Built with C++ and SFML, it’s not just a game—it’s a blend of childhood memories and coding creativity.

## **🎯 What Makes It Special?**
### *👉 🍕 Junk food effects:*
- Pizza, burger, and cheese make your snake grow through Linked List insertions at the head, middle, or tail.
### *👉 🍎 Healthy food effects:*
- Apple, mango, and orange shrink the snake with Linked List deletions at the head, middle, or tail.
- *👉 💀 Poison:* Cuts the snake in half—ouch! 😱
- *👉 🍻 Alcohol:* Reverses the snake’s direction with Linked List reversal magic.
- *👉 🎮 Customization:* Choose between Single or Doubly Linked List modes and see real-time operations with time complexities displayed!
- *👉 ⚡ Intense Gameplay:* Dodge obstacles and avoid self-collision—because if you don’t, it’s game over 💔.

## **✨ Why I’m Proud of This Project:**
- ### *💡 Data Structures in Action:* Mastered Linked Lists and explored STL vectors, all while solving complex challenges.
- *🧩 Clean Code:* Applied OOP principles to create scalable, modular, and flexible code.
- *🎨 Game Dev Skills:* Brought the game to life with smooth visuals, animations, and immersive sound effects using SFML.
- *🚀 Level Design:* Created multiple levels with unique obstacles and layouts, enhancing replayability and player engagement.
- *🧠 Problem-Solving:* Tackled tough challenges, like syncing Linked List operations with real-time gameplay mechanics, for a seamless experience.
